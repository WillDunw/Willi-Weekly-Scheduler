# Schedule-Planner-WPF  

**A personal WPF-based scheduler app to help organize tasks and track time usage effectively.**  

I created this application during my school days to improve time management and identify areas where I was wasting time. Additionally, I challenged myself to learn a new programming language, **Visual Basic .NET**, while building this project.
